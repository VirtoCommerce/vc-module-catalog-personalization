# Catalog Personalization Module
The Catalog Personalization Module enables the personalization of catalogs through the use of User Groups.
This module allows catalog objects such as products and categories to be assigned to User Groups,
and different policies for User Group propagation in the catalog objects hierarchy can be defined.

The Catalog Personalization Module is designed to help businesses personalize their catalogs to specific User Groups.
This module enables catalog objects such as products and categories to be assigned to User Groups to control
their visibility. The module also offers different policies for User Group propagation in the catalog objects hierarchy,
such as UpTree and DownTree.

The Catalog Personalization Module provides a way to manage and assign User Groups to Catalog Objects.
User Groups can be created and assigned to Product Categories for filtration in the storefront search.
