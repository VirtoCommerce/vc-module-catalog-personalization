# Catalog Personalization Module
The Catalog Personalization module enables the personalization of catalogs through the use of User Groups.
This module allows catalog objects such as products and categories to be assigned to User Groups,
and different policies for User Group propagation in the catalog objects hierarchy can be defined.

The Catalog Personalization module is designed to help businesses personalize their catalogs to specific User Groups.
This module enables catalog objects such as products and categories to be assigned to User Groups to control
their visibility. The module also offers different policies for User Group propagation in the catalog objects hierarchy,
such as UpTree and DownTree.

The Catalog Personalization module provides a way to manage and assign User Groups to Catalog Objects.
User Groups can be created and assigned to Product Categories for filtration in the storefront search.

## Key features
* **Catalog visibility personalization**: Control who sees what in your storefront with the Catalog Personalization module.
* **Flexible User Group propagation**: Choose the propagation policy that works best for your catalog hierarchy with the User Group Propagation Policies feature.
* **Filtering with User Groups**: Improve storefront search results by assigning User Groups to Product Categories with the User Groups for Products or Categories Filtration feature.
* **Efficient User Group assignment**: Save time and effort with the Assign User Groups feature, allowing you to easily create and assign User Groups to Catalog Objects.

## User Group propagation
The module supports two policies for User Group propagation in the catalog objects hierarchy: UpTree and DownTree.

1. `UpTree` propagates the tags from descendants to parents up the hierarchy
